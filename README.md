#### pip

Write the command below in your terminal to install the dependencies according to the configuration file requirements.txt.

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run 
The dataset configuration is located at lines 235-236; determine the number of clients at line 222 based on the dataset you wish to run.

For the public dataset(tsu),  You can start the server in a terminal as follows:
```shell
python server.py
```
you will need to open five additional terminal windows and run the following commands.

Start clients 1 through 5 in the first to fifth terminals:

```shell
python client.py --partition-id 1
```
```shell
python client.py --partition-id 2
```
```shell
python client.py --partition-id 3
```
```shell
python client.py --partition-id 4
```
```shell
python client.py --partition-id 5
```
You will see that PyTorch is starting a federated training. 

For the private dataset (sau1,sau2),  You can start the server in a terminal as follows:
```shell
python server.py
```
you will need to open five additional terminal windows and run the following commands.

Start clients 1 and 2 in the two terminals:

```shell
python client.py --partition-id 1
```
```shell
python client.py --partition-id 2
```
You will see that PyTorch is starting a federated training. 

The personalized layer settings are located within two functions at lines 265 and 330 in the `client.py` file, which need to be configured accordingly, and also modify the model save path at line 246.
For example, the content at line 265 of the function should be set to.
```
params_to_upload = {
            'conv1.weight': net.conv1.weight.detach().cpu().numpy(),
            'conv1.bias': net.conv1.bias.detach().cpu().numpy(),
            'bn1.weight': net.bn1.weight.detach().cpu().numpy(),
            'bn1.bias': net.bn1.bias.detach().cpu().numpy(),
            'bn1.running_mean': net.bn1.running_mean.detach().cpu().numpy(),
            'bn1.running_var': net.bn1.running_var.detach().cpu().numpy(),
}
```
Consequently, the function at line 330 should be set to
```
parmname =['conv1.weight','conv1.bias','bn1.weight','bn1.bias','bn1.running_mean','bn1.running_var']
```
and the file save path should be
```
model_save_path = os.path.join('model', 'c1', f'client_{partition_id}_round_{config["round"]}.pth')
```
